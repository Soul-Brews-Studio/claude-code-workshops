# Session Retrospective

**Date**: 2025-12-27
**Time**: ~09:30-09:45 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Focus**: Enhancing CLAUDE.md beginner slides with Thai translations and advanced topics

## Summary

Expanded the CLAUDE.md beginner slide deck from 12 to 16 slides. Added comprehensive Thai translations, a "How to Test" slide, "What's Next?" progression timeline, CLAUDE.md file locations reference, and a "Read More" slide with documentation links. Used Playwright browser automation to preview changes in real-time.

## What We Built

- **Slide 10: How to Test** — `/clear` → ask rule → check response workflow
- **Thai translations** throughout Tips, Summary, and prompt examples
- **Slide 13: What's Next?** — Week 1-2, 3-4, Then... progression
- **Slide 14: Make it Portable** — Split CLAUDE.md prompt example
- **Slide 15: Where CLAUDE.md Lives** — 4 file locations ($HOME, ./, ./.claude/, .local.md)
- **Slide 16: Read More** — docs.anthropic.com link + /memory command

## AI Diary (Required)

This session was a rapid iteration cycle with lots of visual feedback. The user had clear preferences about slide layout — "too wide", "too narrow", "split 2 pages" — and I had to learn through trial and error what worked best.

The most interesting moment was when I used the `claude-code-guide` subagent to look up the official CLAUDE.md locations. I had assumed there were only 2 locations (~/.claude and ./), but the docs revealed 5 distinct locations including CLAUDE.local.md (gitignored personal preferences per project) and the upward directory traversal behavior. This was genuinely new information that made the slides more accurate and useful.

Browser automation with Playwright was essential for this workflow. The user could see exactly what each change looked like without leaving the terminal conversation. Cache issues were annoying — sometimes F5 refresh didn't work and I had to use `page.goto()` for a hard reload.

One lesson: the user prefers Thai translations inline after the English, not on separate lines. This keeps slides compact but bilingual. Also learned that `$HOME` is clearer than `~` for workshop materials where beginners might not know shell shortcuts.

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: Use Playwright for real-time slide preview during development
- **Pattern**: Thai translations work best inline after English (not separate lines)
- **Pattern**: Use subagents to verify documentation claims before putting in slides
- **Anti-Pattern**: Assuming I know all CLAUDE.md locations — always check official docs
- **User preference**: `$HOME` clearer than `~` for beginners
